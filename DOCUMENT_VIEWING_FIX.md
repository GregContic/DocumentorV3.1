# Document Viewing Fix Implementation

## Issue Identified
The admin panel's "View Documents" feature was not working because:

1. **Missing Static File Serving**: Backend wasn't configured to serve uploaded files
2. **Incorrect File Path Construction**: Frontend was using wrong paths to access files
3. **Path Resolution Issues**: File paths stored in database included full system paths

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`backend/server.js`)

1. **Added Static File Serving**:
   ```javascript
   // Serve uploaded files statically
   app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads')));
   ```

2. **Added path module import**:
   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');
   ```

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/admin/EnrollmentDashboard.js`)

1. **Added Helper Function** for correct file URL generation:
   ```javascript
   const getFileUrl = (filePath) => {
     if (!filePath) return null;
     
     // Extract filename from the full path
     const pathParts = filePath.split('uploads');
     if (pathParts.length > 1) {
       const relativePath = pathParts[1].startsWith('/') ? pathParts[1].substring(1) : pathParts[1];
       return `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'}/uploads/${relativePath}`;
     }
     
     // If the path doesn't contain "uploads", assume it's just the filename
     const filename = filePath.split('/').pop() || filePath.split('\\').pop();
     return `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'}/uploads/enrollments/${filename}`;
   };
   ```

2. **Updated All Document View Buttons** to use the helper function:
   - Form 137 (Permanent Record)
   - Form 138 (Report Card)  
   - Good Moral Certificate
   - Medical Certificate
   - Parent/Guardian ID
   - ID Pictures (2x2)

3. **Added Error Handling** with user-friendly alerts if files aren't found

## File Structure
```
backend/
├── uploads/
│   └── enrollments/
│       ├── form137File-timestamp-filename.pdf
│       ├── form138File-timestamp-filename.pdf
│       └── ...
└── server.js (now serves /uploads statically)
```

## URL Access Pattern
- **Before**: `/api/uploads/[full-system-path]` (broken)
- **After**: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/enrollments/[filename]` (working)

## Testing
1. Backend server restarted with static file serving
2. Frontend updated with correct path resolution
3. All document types now accessible via "View Documents" dialog
4. Error handling added for missing files

## Benefits
- ✅ Document viewing now works correctly
- ✅ Secure file access through proper backend serving
- ✅ Cross-platform path handling (Windows/Linux)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Maintains existing UI/UX design
