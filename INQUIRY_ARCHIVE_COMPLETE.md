# âœ… Inquiry Archive System - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ **Task Completed: Move All Completed Inquiries to Archive**

All completed inquiries will now be automatically moved to the archive page. Here's what has been implemented:

## ðŸ”§ **Backend Changes:**

### 1. **Auto-Archive Logic** (`backend/controllers/inquiryController.js`)
- âœ… When inquiry status is set to "completed", it automatically becomes "archived"
- âœ… Sets `archivedAt` timestamp and `resolvedBy` information
- âœ… Completed inquiries no longer appear in active inquiry lists

### 2. **Bulk Archive Endpoint**
- âœ… New endpoint: `POST /api/inquiries/admin/bulk-archive-completed`
- âœ… Allows admins to archive all existing completed inquiries at once
- âœ… Returns count of archived inquiries for confirmation

### 3. **Migration Scripts**
- âœ… `scripts/migrateCompletedInquiries.js` - Basic migration script
- âœ… `scripts/bulkArchiveInquiries.js` - Enhanced bulk archive script  
- âœ… `scripts/checkInquiryStatus.js` - Status verification script

## ðŸŽ¨ **Frontend Changes:**

### 1. **Fixed Archive Navigation** (`frontend/src/admin/Dashboard.js`)
- âœ… Archive button now correctly points to `/admin/archive` (unified archive page)
- âœ… No longer points to the old `/admin/documents/archive`

### 2. **Enhanced Archive Page** (`frontend/src/admin/Archive.js`)
- âœ… Added "Archive All Completed Inquiries" button on the Inquiries tab
- âœ… Button triggers bulk archiving of any remaining completed inquiries
- âœ… Shows success confirmation with count of archived items
- âœ… Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- âœ… Added `bulkArchiveCompletedInquiries()` method
- âœ… Connects to the new backend endpoint

## ðŸš€ **How It Works:**

### **Automatic Archiving:**
1. When admin marks an inquiry as "completed" â†’ it automatically becomes "archived"
2. Archived inquiries appear in the Archive page under "Inquiries" tab
3. They are removed from active inquiry lists

### **Manual Bulk Archiving:**
1. Go to Admin â†’ Archive â†’ Inquiries tab
2. Click "Archive All Completed Inquiries" button
3. All inquiries with status "completed" are moved to "archived"
4. Success message shows how many were archived

### **Verification:**
1. Run `node scripts/checkInquiryStatus.js` to see current inquiry status
2. Check the Archive page to see archived inquiries
3. Search and filter functionality works for archived items

## ðŸ“‹ **To Use the System:**

### **For New Inquiries:**
- Simply mark inquiries as "completed" in the admin panel
- They will automatically appear in the archive

### **For Existing Completed Inquiries:**
1. **Option A: Use the Frontend Button**
   - Go to Archive page â†’ Inquiries tab
   - Click "Archive All Completed Inquiries"

2. **Option B: Run Migration Script**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/bulkArchiveInquiries.js
   ```

3. **Option C: Check Status First**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/checkInquiryStatus.js
   ```

## âœ¨ **Features:**
- âœ… **Automatic archiving** when marked complete
- âœ… **Bulk archiving** button for existing completed inquiries
- âœ… **Unified archive page** with tabs for documents and inquiries
- âœ… **Search and filter** functionality in archive
- âœ… **Restore capability** to move items back to active status
- âœ… **Detailed view** with full inquiry information
- âœ… **Status verification** scripts for debugging

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result:**
All completed inquiries are now automatically moved to the archive page where they can be searched, viewed, and managed separately from active inquiries!
